# Get Started

There are three options for setting up `basecast`.


## Option 1: Via Container

Running `basecast` in an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/){ target='_blank' }
(Docker) container is the recommended way to try `basecast`
because it avoids many common installation problems.

## Option 2: Locally Installed

Running `basecast` via a container
 will download and cache almost a gigabyte of container image data.
Installing `basecast` directly will consume much less disk space.
However, installing locally is more difficult and might not work.

## Option 3: Via GitHub

Documentation and a demonstration of setting up a GitHub repository to run `basecast` is
 currently under development.
Email Castedo to find out the status and get an early preview.
