# Basecast

Basecast is an authoring tool that:

* generates [baseprint](https://perm.pub/H5NOlCVM9P5Vv4LbeuwJsaME8kM) contents,
* reads [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) source formats such as LaTeX and Markdown,
* can generate HTML and PDF previews,
* can automatically regenerate outputs when source files are edited, and
* is [open-source](https://gitlab.com/castedo/basecast).

Basecast can be run in the cloud (GitHub) or from the command line.


## Run in the cloud (GitHub)

A "BasecastBot" repository will automatically generate and deploy a baseprint preview to
[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
upon changes to document source files in the repository.
An example of a baseprint preview automatically generated by a BastcastBot repository is
[castedo.github.io/basecastbot-example/](https://castedo.github.io/basecastbot-example/).


### GitHub Step 1:

The quickest way to get started is to use
[basecastbot-example](https://github.com/castedo/basecastbot-example/)
as a template to create a BasecastBot repository for your new document.

[Create a BasecastBot repository](
https://github.com/new?template_owner=castedo&template_name=basecastbot-example
){ .md-button .md-button--primary target='_blank' }

For alternative options, such as when a repository already exists, visit the
[Basecast build action](https://github.com/castedo/basecast-build-action).


### GitHub Step 2:

Perform the following substeps for
[publishing with a custom GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)
(copied from GitHub Docs):

- On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.
- Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the dropdown menu, then click Settings.
- In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click Pages.
- Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select GitHub Actions.

Since the [basecastbot-example](https://github.com/castedo/basecastbot-example/)
template already includes a `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yaml` workflow,
no additional subsets are needed.


### GitHub Step 3:

Edit and commit a source file into the repository (for example `pandocin.yaml`).
A build and deploy will be automatically triggered.
When the GitHub Action completes, you can visit
https://**username**.github.io/**repository_name**/
to preview the baseprint as a web page and PDF.


## Run from the command line

Instead of running basecast as a GitHub Action,
you can run basecast from the command line.
Here's a trivial example of bash commands that demonstrate `basecast`:

```
echo Hello World > doc.md
basecast doc.md --baseprint=out
```

The example above will generate a baseprint in the subdirectory `out`
(which will contain a JATS XML file named `article.xml`).

To use Basecast from the command line, it needs to be either "installed" via containers
or installed locally.


### Setup 1: Container

Running `basecast` in an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/){ target='_blank' }
(Docker) container is the recommended way to try `basecast`
because it avoids many common installation problems.

[Setup via containers](containers.md){ .md-button }


### Setup 2: Packages

Running `basecast` via a container
will download and cache almost a gigabyte of container image data.
Installing `basecast` directly will consume much less disk space.
However, installing packages locally is more difficult and might not work.
