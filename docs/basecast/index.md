# Basecast

Basecast is an open-source authoring tool that outputs a baseprint and live previews in HTML and/or PDF formats.
Built on top of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org),
this tool can take many input formats supported by pandoc.
In particular, basecast supports both markdown and the subset of LaTeX supported by pandoc.

As of 2023, basecast is under development. Source code is available at
[gitlab.com/castedo/basecast](https://gitlab.com/castedo/basecast).
