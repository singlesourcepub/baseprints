# Baseprints

Read the document "[What is a baseprint?](https://perm.pub/HKSI5NPzMFmgRlb4Vboi71OTKYo)"
for a definition of _baseprint_. That document itself also serves as an example of a baseprint.
Baseprints are used as digital objects (or editions) inside a digital succession.
Visit [try.perm.pub](https://try.perm.pub/) to learn about digital successions of baseprints.
For technical details and an illustration of a baseprint, see the [Technical Details page](tech.md).


## Software

[Basecast](https://try.perm.pub/basecast/) is an example of software that **writes** a baseprint.
This is demonstrated in the tutorial

[BaseprintPress](https://gitlab.com/perm.pub/baseprintpress)
is an example of software that **reads** a baseprint.
