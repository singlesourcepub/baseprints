Baseprint Feature D's
---------------------

The GitHub Discussions category
[Baseprint Feature D's](https://github.com/singlesourcepub/baseprints/discussions/categories/baseprint-feature-d-s)
is available to facilitate discussions, decisions, proposals, definitions, etc...
that focus on specific features of a Baseprint format.


Snapshots vs. Successions
-------------------------

[Baseprint Document Format (BpDF)](bdf/index.md) is the
digital encoding format for *Baseprint document snapshots*,
which can be redistributed and archived through various mechanisms.
Some preprint servers could archive Baseprint document snapshots in a centralized
approach.
Alternatively, Baseprint document snapshots can be redistributed and archived
in a distributed approach, such as [*Baseprint document successions*](successions.md).
