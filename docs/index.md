## Reading baseprints

There are several ways to access an archived baseprint:

* Run software to retrieve a baseprint from a git repository.
* Run software to retrieve a baseprint from the [Software Heritage
 Archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/).
* Browse to a baseprint indexed by [perm.pub](https://perm.pub).
* Browse to an independent website that presents a baseprint as HTML and/or PDF.
* Browse to a baseprint that has been archived at the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org).

The easiest way for readers is to visit [perm.pub](https://perm.pub/) or an independent
website that serves HTML and PDF presentations of baseprints.
For example, one way to read the document "What is a baseprint?" is to
browse to the URL:

[https://perm.pub/H5NOlCVM9P5Vv4LbeuwJsaME8kM](https://perm.pub/H5NOlCVM9P5Vv4LbeuwJsaME8kM)

An application that you can run on your own computer to read archived baseprints is
currently being developed.
An open-source software utility and library that can convert a baseprint into a webpage
and PDF file is [epijats](https://gitlab.com/perm.pub/epijats).
