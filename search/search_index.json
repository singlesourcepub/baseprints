PubMed Central JATS XML Flavor: The various different software systems of different organizations process different \"flavors\" of JATS XML. Baseprint JATS XML does not target supporting the various flavors of JATS.  Baseprint JATS XML targets processing a subset of the JATS XML found in archived articles of the PMC Open Access Subset. Baseprint JATS XML targets matching the rendering of the PMC Article Previewer. JATS4R: Baseprint JATS XML targets being similarly restrictive like JATS4R (JATS for Reuse). However, Baseprint JATS XML targets re-use by Free Open-Source Software for author self-archiving/publishing redistribution within Baseprint document successions. Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA): Unlike JATS XML, BpDF is also a format for the packaging of the files included in a research document, such as images. In this respect, BpDF is similar to the Manuscript Exchange Common Approach (MECA) Both BpDF and MECA are interchange formats between authoring and archiving. However, unlike MECA, BpDF targets author self-archiving/publishing and redistribution and not traditional publisher workflows. BpDF'23 BpDF'23 is the version of BpDF supported by the epijats Python library in 2023 and 2024."}]}
